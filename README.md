## About 
This project is planned to use a data set on the acquisitions and funding of start-ups.
It is aimed to focus on the analysis of the dataset to deduce the reasons behind the success and failure of a start-up. 
The goal from the analysis is to deduce how much funding on average does a start-up usually require, 
reasons behind their failure in case of dissolving or reasons behind their success. 
The dataset is based on 66368 start-up companies, while some of these start-ups were acquired by other companies, specifically 18969. 
Moreover, 168647 investments were made in those start-ups. The dataset consists of 5 files: acquisitions, additions, companies, investments and rounds. 
Each file will contribute to reaching those goals. 
First, the acquisitions file shows the companies that got acquired, 
acquired by whom and when, and how much it was acquired for. 
Second, the companies file shows all information about the start-up companies including their name, 
location, whether operating or not, and its funding information. 
Lastly, the investments file shows which company was invested in by which company, 
how much was paid for it, and the type and amount of funding.
